# Project-Lingo
The idea is to findout how countries are connected through common languages.

In the begining the goal was to find the rason behind the death of a language. But over time it became a major task to find the right data set. Failing to find a convincing dataset lead to scrapping data mainly from 
https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/402.html#NH 
and 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay#Language
For all the countries.

The data scrapped is manily, the nameof the country, population, languages spoken, child moretality, maternal mortality, GDP exchange rate, major religions practised and geographical coordinates.
